# AdA

The "Angeh√∂riger der Armee" (AdA) Application is a Spring Boot-based solution that is comprised of multiple microservices. 
The application has been specifically designed to address the logistic needs of the Swiss military service. 
It offers a user-friendly platform for checking in and checking out personnel, as well as completing assessments 
to verify their skills. 

The application also provides a convenient way to create theoretical and practical lectures, and offers a material 
ordering system that operates like an e-commerce platform. This allows users to order necessary materials directly 
from the warehouse. 

Ada Application streamlines the logistic process and provides a centralized solution for 
managing personnel and resources.
